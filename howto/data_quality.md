## Identifying and Addressing Data Quality Issues

Presumably by conducting some simple data anlysis and visualization, some issues related to quality have been presented. These could include things like duplicate records, non-standard dates or times, inconsistent data entry (all caps, some caps, no caps), or any one of the items on [this list](https://github.com/Quartz/bad-data-guide). **Adressing these issues, in the most efficient manner possible, may be the most critical component to implmenting a successful anaytics program.**
