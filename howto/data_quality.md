## Identifying and Addressing Data Quality Issues

Presumably by conducting some simple data anlysis and visualization, some issues related to quality have been presented. These could include things like duplicate records, non-standard dates or times, inconsistent data entry (all caps, some caps, no caps), or any one of the items on [this list](https://github.com/Quartz/bad-data-guide). **Adressing these issues, in the most efficient manner possible, may be the most critical component to implmenting a successful anaytics program.**

###Start at the point of entry###
Correcting data quality issues at the point data is entered or captured is ideal. This requires less donwstream effort to prepare data for analysis, and less maintenance of any software, tools, or code which may be used to correct for these issues.

Step 1: **Talk to a person who physically enters the data**
* Observe them enteriing data
* Ask them if they understand what is supposed to be entered and how
