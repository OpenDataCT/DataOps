## DataOps (for Government) Ideas and Tools

Currently a running list of things I've encountered in meeting with different departments that would add value to data ops processes

### Data Quality Measurement - Department of Developmental Services:
Recently met with the Department of Developmental Service to discuss how a DataOps (for Government) approach might help them. One thing that they are already doing for one program, that would clearly add value to other areas is measuring data quality associated with their Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) System. "CAD systems are all about speed" according to the IT Director, thus data quality can often suffer. Using Tableau, they implemented a data quality dashboard, which displayed by Officer (?? verify this) data entry errors. Officers began taking pride in the quality of their data, and thus sought to correct any issues as quickly as possible.

Considerations: This seems to be predicated on a sense of pride and a bit of friendly competition that might be embedded in the culture of this particular group. It seems possible that other groups might view this with more of a fearful eye. In essence, some employees may view this simply as another tool to be used in criticizing their performance, and thus operate out of fear.
