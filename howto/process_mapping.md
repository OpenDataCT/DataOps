## DataOps for Government: Process Mapping, Evaluation, and Improvement

*Define and Measure*
1.	Identify a problem or question(s) to understand or solve
2.	Identify the various data sources that may help in addressing the question(s) or problem.
3.	Identify team members to work with: [Forming Your DataOps Team](team)
4.	Identify and define common symbols and terms that will be used to map out your current data analysis process (i.e. flow chart)
5.	Define the scope/process boundaries (start and end)
6.	Define the “size” of the issue/problem you’re trying to understand or solve (how much, how often, how long, etc.)
7.	Identify the different roles in association with the process (data collectors/enterers, database admins, report generators, analyzers, decisions makers)
8.	Identify the inputs and outputs of the current process 
9.	Collect all relevant information as it relates to the process (legislation, regulation, access to data, existing software tools)
10.	“Walk the process” – go through the current data analysis process
11.	Map the process as it is, step by step
12.	Document any issues with the data, steps, and/or the roles as you go – you won’t get it right the first time!
