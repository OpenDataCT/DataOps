## Answer Simple Questions Repeatedly
Ideally, non technical users should be able to answer simple business questions on their own, without the assistance of more technical staff.

* Identify small number of simple questions users may have: How much did we spend? How many permits did we process? What was the average length of time? etc.
* What is the easiest way to answer these questions? Do they need a chart, a map, or text?
