## Answer Simple Questions Repeatedly
Ideally, non technical users should be able to answer simple business questions on their own, without the assistance of more technical staff.

* Identify small number, approximately 5-10 simple questions users may have: How much did we spend? How many permits did we process? What was the average length of time? etc.
* Identify data sources that can help answer these questions.
* Generate datasets that will be used to answer the questions.
* Use existing tools to develop asnwers. Validate the results.
* What is the easiest way for a user to answer these questions? Do they need a chart, a map, or text?


### What to think about
* How succesful were they in answering these questions?
* Were the answers correct?
* Were they able to do this on a daily basis?
* Did they generate additional questions?
