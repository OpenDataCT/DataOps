Understanding the Data Pipeline:

Data Collection:
Who is collecting data and/or entering data; under what circumstances. 
  Are data collected in the field? Is a form filled out and then entered later? During an interview?

What controls exist at the point of entry? 
  Which fields domain controlled (i.e. Drop downs, check boxes, true/false)
  Which fields are required?
  Which fields enforce rules, formatting, or validate entry (addresses, dates, etc)
  Are any fields “re-purposed” or used for a purpose which may not be included in documentation?
